1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
For the Breading:

1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (adjust to your desired spiciness)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
For the Spicy Mayo:

1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon hot sauce (e.g., Sriracha, Frank's Red Hot, or your favorite)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper, to taste
For Frying:

Vegetable oil, for frying
For Assembly:

4 brioche buns, toasted
Lettuce leaves
Sliced tomatoes
Sliced red onion
Pickles (optional)
Instructions:

Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl or ziplock bag, combine buttermilk, hot sauce, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Add the chicken breasts, ensuring they are fully coated. Cover or seal and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight for maximum flavor.

Prepare the breading: In a shallow dish, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.

Coat the chicken: Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting the excess drip off. Dredge the chicken in the breading mixture, pressing the flour mixture into the chicken to ensure a thick, even coating. Set the breaded chicken on a wire rack or plate.

Heat the oil: In a deep, heavy skillet or Dutch oven, heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil to 350째F (175째C). You can use a deep-fry thermometer to monitor the temperature.

Fry the chicken: Carefully lower the breaded chicken breasts into the hot oil, frying one piece at a time if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan. Cook for 5-7 minutes per side or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C) and the breading is golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain.

Prepare the spicy mayo: In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, hot sauce, garlic powder, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Assemble the sandwiches: Spread a generous layer of spicy mayo on the bottom half of each toasted brioche bun. Top with lettuce, tomato, and red onion slices. Place a fried chicken breast on top, followed by pickles (if desired). Finish with the top half of the brioche bun.

Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade spicy chicken sandwich!
